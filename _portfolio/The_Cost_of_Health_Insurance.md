### Introduction
There are many factors that drive the increasing costs of health insurance. This project was a collaborative effort with one other teammate with the goal to predict the cost of health insurance, based on the characteristics of the policy holder. 
 
### Tools
* Python and Jupyter Notebook 
* Libraries
  * pandas
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * seaborn
  * scikit-learn

### Data
[Medical Cost Personal Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance)

### Modeling Methods
* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest

### Conclusion
Our random forest model provided a R-squared value of 0.86 and a mean absolute error of 2022.03. These results indicate that 86% of the data fits the model and our prediction is off by $2022.03 on average.
