### Introduction
Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies are performed on masses found in breast tissue. During this procedure, a hallow needle attached to a syringe is used to withdraw tissue or fluid from the mass. This goal of this project was to perform exploratory data analysis. Additionally, I used the data from FNA biopsies to predict breast cancer diagnosis using logistic regression.

### Tools
* Python and Jupyter Notebook 
* Libraries
  * thinkstats2
  * thinkplot
  * pandas
  * math
  * statistics
  * statsmodel.formula.api

### Data
[Breast Cancer Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/merishnasuwal/breast-cancer-prediction-dataset)

### Techniques Used
* Histograms
* Cumulative Distribution Function
* Scatterplots
* Correlation
* Permutation Hypothesis Tests
* Lognormal Transformation
* Logistic Regression

### Conclusion
Through my exploratory data analysis, I was able to predict a malignant diagnosis using logistic regression with 94% accuracy.
