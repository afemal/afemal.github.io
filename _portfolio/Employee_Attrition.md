### Introduction
Employee attrition is the natural process in which employees leave the workforce. High attrition rates may result in a variety of problems for a company. The goal of this project was to understand the factors that affect employee attrition to help predict which employees of the company were at risk. In turn, the company could implement different techniques and incentives to retain these employees and reduce the overall attrition rate.
